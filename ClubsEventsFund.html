        <h1>Clubs Events Fund Subsidy</h1>
        <p>
          Clubs and Societies are a major part of what makes students'
          experience warm, united and even academically friendly. With Rs.
          5,00,000/- allocated, this fund provides support for club events on
          campus while maintaining sustainable practices and equitable
          distribution across all recognized clubs.

        <p>
          Clubs and Societies are a major part of what makes students'
          experience warm, united and even academically friendly. From this
          sub-section, the policy aims to provide club event funds. The policy
          has been made keeping in mind the limited funds and the number of
          clubs on the campus. This policy has been made with concern for the
          type of event and how we can help their causes with suitable support.

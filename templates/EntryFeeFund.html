          The maximum amount of money that the Free Students' Union Pulchowk
          Campus will fund is given as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>

        <div class="badge-subsection">Outdoor and Indoor Sport</div>
        <p>
          Outdoor sports are played in open natural environments like fields or
          natural terrains, such as football, hiking, emphasising endurance,
          natural elements, and larger spaces for activities. Indoor sports are
          played in a sheltered, controlled environment, such as a gym or
          stadium, and often focus on skill and precision, with examples like
          chess and table tennis.
        </p>

        <div class="badge-subsection">Home and Away Team</div>
        <p>
          When a team plays on its own campus premises, organised by the
          students of their own campus, the game will be regarded as the home
          team. Otherwise, it will be regarded as the away team.
        </p>

        <div class="badge-subsection">Contingency with the entry fee</div>
        <p>
          The sports team will receive the diet of Rs. 60/day/person, assured by
          a manager of the team appointed by the Free Students' Union Pulchowk
          Campus executive committee. The coach for any event will be addressed
          by the Free Students' Union Pulchowk Campus executive committee with
          regard to the treasury of the Union.

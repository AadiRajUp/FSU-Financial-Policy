        <h1>FSU Internal Fund</h1>
        <p>
          With Rs. 10,00,000/- allocated, the FSU Internal Fund serves as a
          flexible pool of resources to support diverse campus initiatives. The
          policy intentionally does not break the amount into line items,
          allowing the FSU to deploy funds strategically throughout the year
          based on campus needs and priorities.

        <div class="badge">Transparency Rule</div>
        <p>
          To be subject to a fair system, as the policy advocates, the monthly
          expenditure of the treasury must be made public to the campus students
          through the Discord Server and Facebook page. The right of the
          students of Pulchowk Campus to know how the union is utilising its
          resources must be maintained in any case.

        <p>
          If the funds allotted to certain sub-sections are insufficient, they
          will be taken from Part 6 of the <a href="{{url_for('static',filename='resources/Financial Policy 2082.pdf')}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Policy</a>.; if they are more than
          required, they will be funded to Part 6 of the <a href="{{url_for('static',filename='resources/Financial Policy 2082.pdf')}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Policy</a>. This ensures
          efficient allocation of resources and maintains the overall financial
          stability of the FSU.
